Task:

The interest rate on the loan (percent % per annum), the loan term (months months) and the loan amount (total euros) are set.

It is necessary to calculate the size of the annuity payment using a binary search: payments each month must be equal, as with a regular loan or mortgage.

Each payment fully pays all accumulated interest, the remaining amount goes to repay the body of the loan.

This means that in the first month your payment consists almost only of accrued interest, and in the last month almost only of the loan body.
